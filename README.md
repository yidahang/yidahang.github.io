<em>My notes</em>
<p>
HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.<br>
HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>.<br>
When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.<br>
HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. <br>
Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
